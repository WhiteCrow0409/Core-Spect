Absolutely! Here's a **refreshed, more concise, and professional version** of your README file for the CoreSpect project. I’ve restructured it for clarity, improved flow, and made it easier to scan.

# 🛡️ CoreSpect — Product Verification Platform

**CoreSpect** is a machine learning-based platform designed to predict whether a product is **verified** or **not**, using both structured product data and unstructured customer reviews. By integrating sentiment analysis and supervised learning, the system evaluates product credibility, helping customers make more informed decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Product Authenticity Prediction**  
  Classifies products as **verified (1)** or **not verified (0)** based on key features.

- 💬 **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Leverages customer reviews using **TextBlob** to gauge sentiment and enhance feature depth.

- 📊 **Feature Engineering**  
  Extracts meaningful indicators from pricing, discounts, ratings, and review polarity.

- 🧠 **Machine Learning**  
  Trains a `RandomForestClassifier` to classify products based on engineered features.

- 📈 **Evaluation & Visualization**  
  Uses classification metrics and rich visualizations to evaluate and understand model behavior.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains product metadata, user reviews, and customer ratings. Key columns include:

- `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`
- `discounted_price`, `actual_price`, `discount_percentage`
- `rating`, `rating_count`
- `review_title`, `review_content`, `about_product`
- `user_id`, `user_name`, `review_id`
- `img_link`, `product_link`

---

## 🧱 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Using TextBlob to extract polarity from `review_content`
   - Categorizing reviews as positive, neutral, or negative
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating a `verification` label based on custom thresholds (rating, sentiment, etc.)
4. **Model Training**
   - Random Forest model built and trained on structured + sentiment features
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix
6. **Data Visualization**
   - Heatmaps, box plots, scatter plots, distribution plots

---

## 📊 Results

- The `RandomForestClassifier` showed strong performance in predicting product verification.
- Incorporating review sentiment improved classification accuracy.
- Visualizations revealed key relationships among features such as discount, ratings, and sentiment.
